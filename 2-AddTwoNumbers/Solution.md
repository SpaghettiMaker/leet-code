# Intuition
The problem is about adding two numbers represented as linked lists. The first thought is to mimic how we perform addition manually. Starting from the least significant digit, we add corresponding digits from the two linked lists while carrying over any overflow to the next digit. This process can be naturally implemented using recursion.

# Approach
The approach is recursive:
1. At each step, we add the values of the current nodes from both lists, along with any carry from the previous addition.
2. If one list is shorter than the other, we treat the missing values as `0`.
3. We calculate the new carry and the current digit using integer division and modulus operations (`/` and `%`).
4. The recursion continues with the next nodes from both lists, until we reach the end of both lists and there's no carry left.
5. The base case returns `null` when there are no more digits and no carry.

This recursive approach ensures that we traverse the linked lists only once and directly construct the resulting linked list.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  $$O(\max(m, n))$$  
  where $$m$$ and $$n$$ are the lengths of the two linked lists. This is because we process each node exactly once.

- **Space complexity:**  
  $$O(\max(m, n))$$  
  due to the recursion stack, which can go as deep as the longer of the two linked lists.

# Code
```java

public class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        return recursiveSolution(l1, l2, 0);
    }

    private ListNode recursiveSolution(ListNode l1, ListNode l2, int carry) {
        if (l1 == null && l2 == null && carry == 0) {
            return null;
        }

        int l1Value = (l1 != null) ? l1.val : 0;
        int l2Value = (l2 != null) ? l2.val : 0;

        int sum = l1Value + l2Value + carry;
        int newCarry = sum / 10;
        int currentValue = sum % 10;

        return new ListNode(
                currentValue,
                recursiveSolution(
                        (l1 != null) ? l1.next : null,
                        (l2 != null) ? l2.next : null,
                        newCarry));
    }
}
```
